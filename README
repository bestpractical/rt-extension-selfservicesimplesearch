NAME
    RT-Extension-SelfServiceSimpleSearch - Adds Simple Search to SelfService

DESCRIPTION
    This adds RT's standard Simple Search interface to the SelfService
    portal. This is useful if unprivileged requestors are given passwords,
    and the Requestor or Cc roles are granted the ShowTicket right; it
    allows those users to search through their tickets more effectively than
    the stock SelfService pages do.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0 and RT 4.2.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions
